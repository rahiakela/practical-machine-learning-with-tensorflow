We will work with a dataset of Shakespeare's writing from Andrej Karpathy's [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). Given a sequence of characters from this data (\"Shakespear\"), train a model to predict the next character in the sequence (\"e\"). Longer sequences of text can be generated by calling the model repeatedly.\n",
